# Spring-Travel
The Spring Travel project involves planning for the upcoming Admission's travel events in greater New England. Planning involves:

* Review previous year's ad run schedule. 
* Review previous year's ad performance. 
* Review previous year's June report on the preliminary Spring travel review. 
* Review previous year's inquiries and applicants during the ad run time + 2 weeks using Initial Source Date. 
* Review previous year's visits to website from the targeted areas.

There has been an increase in inquiries in all the targeted counties in CT, MA, VT from Spring 2016 to 2017. It is notable that there was a 96% increase in inquiries in CT and a 69% increase in inquiries in MA from 2016 to 2017. Rhode Island, a state not targeted in 2016, saw a growth in inquiries in both counties targeted.  VT saw a 55% increase in inquiries overall; only 1 county, Windsor, remained flat in growth. There were no Admissions travel events held in Belknap, NH in Spring, 2017. 

Inquiries in NH fell in all targeted counties between 45-75% during the Spring Travel Campaign. 

Overall, inquiries increased from 1282 in 2016 to 1454 in 2017 (+ 13%)  from March-May. 




Applicants:(still needs to be updates with corrected numbers)

CT, VT, and RI show a positive change in growth in applicants generated during the Spring Travel Campaign. However not all counties in these states show growth.  

NH has largest decrease in applicants year over year in the Spring Admissions Visit periods, from 79 in 2016 to 16 in 2017.  

Overall,  applicants decreased from 238 in 2016 to 118 in 2017 during the months of February, March, and April.

An increase in inquiries is very positive.

Next steps include looking at enrollments, geo-targeted engagement in the website using event site addresses. Additionally, it is important to look at the participant’s class because many of the attendees were Juniors, therefore not necessarily becoming Inquiries or Applicants this soon in the process. We will continue to monitor performance year over year for inquiries and applicants and analyze the performance of the advertisements themselves.
